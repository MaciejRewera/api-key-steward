# Reporting Security Issues

We take security in api-key-steward very seriously.
We follow the rules of [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure), and we appreciate your efforts to do so as well, instead of reporting vulnerabilities publicly.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory [Report a Vulnerability](https://github.com/MaciejRewera/api-key-steward/security/advisories/new) tab.
